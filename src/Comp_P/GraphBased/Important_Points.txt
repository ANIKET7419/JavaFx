Diameter of Tree: ->

It is the longest path between two any leaf nodes among all leaf nodes pairs

For Example :->

     1
    / \
   2    3
  / \  / \
 4  5  6  7

  Options are :->
  Paths between all pairs of leaf nodes
  (4,5),(4,6),(4,7),(5,6),(5,7),(6,7)

  4 -> 2 -> 5
  4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3->6
  4 ->2 -> 1 -> 3 ->7
  5 ->2 ->  1-> 3 ->6
  5 ->2 ->1 -> 3-> 7
  6 -> 3 ->7

   It is not necessary that root must include in longest path.



 MHT (Minimum Height Trees Problem ) :->

   In this problem we have to find the root nodes that form minimum height tree .
   For an undirected graph with tree characteristics, we can choose any node as the root. The result graph is then a rooted tree. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height are called minimum height trees (MHTs). Given such a graph, write a function to find all the MHTs and return a list of their root labels.

   Format
   The graph contains n nodes which are labeled from 0 to n - 1. You will be given the number n and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of labels).

   You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are undirected, [0, 1] is the same as [1, 0] and thus will not appear together in edges.



  Remember :->  Number of root nodes for this problem will be MINIMUM - 1 AND MAXIMUM - 2
                These root nodes are the center of the Diameter .
                Why ?  Because height of any node depend on the longest path  of left side or  right side to last level leaf node under that subtree



 Important : -> if the length of the longest path is even we have two MHT otherwise 1


  That is why leaf cutting approach is best for MHT that follow same diameter pattern

      4 -> 2 -> 5
      4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3->6
      4 ->2 -> 1 -> 3 ->7
      5 ->2 ->  1-> 3 ->6
      5 ->2 ->1 -> 3-> 7
      6 -> 3 ->7

      Leaf Nodes are 4,5,6,7  because they have degree 1
      Cut all these nodes

      After that result is : ->

             2
            2 -> 1 -> 3
            2 -> 1 -> 3
            2 ->  1-> 3
            2 ->1 -> 3
             3
      Nodes remaining in the original tree is 3

      So cut again all leaf nodes

         1
         1
         1
         1

       Now remaining node is only 1 that is not greater than 2
       so we need to stop cutting so our answer is 1

If a tree have all nodes having degree 1 then all nodes are answer for MHT again maximum is 2
Otherwise leaf node can not be treated as root for MHT problem.
