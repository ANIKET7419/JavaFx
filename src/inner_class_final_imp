class Outer{
class Inner{

}
}

(2)
class Outer{
function(){


local data

class Inner{

}

}
}

Note : IN case 2 there is special case that Inner class can access all data of Outer class and have privilege  to
change data but it can access local data of that function in which it lies it can not change it's local data . Note  that it is not compulsory to make final those local data that
you are accessing in the inner class but make sure if you are using local data then if your inner class changing the local data in compile time
error will be generated otherwise not .
