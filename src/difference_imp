IN PYTHON , JAVASCRIPT , PHP , R -> FUNCTIONS ARE OBJECT 
so they dont support function overloading
in python class is also object of type class
Note : -> c++ , php , r , python , javascript support default arguments but java does not except varargs
Note :-> in javascript we can pass arguments or not it is not compulsory whether you defined some parameter as default or simple it simple take undefined value if not passed
arguments array can be used to access parameters values 
otherwise all language want parameters should be intialed while calling 
Note special case with R is [ line 7 ] is somehow different for R in r  parameters should be intialed while calling if variable is used in function ] simple undefined error will be encountered
C++ , PHP SUPPORT & by reference 
But java does not support & ( by refernce ) 
In java varargs can be declared  only and only  in function prototype






========= Boolean ======

in java boolean is boolean it is not equal to 0 or 1 we can not type cast it to any or any to boolean it is illegal
In javascript , c++ , php ,R,python  boolean is 0 or 1 [ 0 == false ]( true) [1== true ](true) but [2==true] (false) [2==false] (false)
bcz it is always converted into 0 or 1 when an arithmetic, relational,logical etc operations are applied
Special is \\\ example - while(10) //it is considered as true but not equal to true [infinite loop]
 while(0) //false
 while(0.1) //true [infinite loop]
 but 0, null,None,undefinded,NULL,NaN are considered as false in these special case
in javascript and c++ if size of collection is 0 then it is considered as true in special cases
in python , php if size of collection is 0 then it is considered as false in special case
in r if size of collection is 0 then it is an error [ shows :  argument is of length zero ]
