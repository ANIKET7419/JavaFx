floating point remainder :-
a  and b are floating point numbers
ex :- a%b
remainder = a - n*b here n is the integral part such that n<=(int)(a/b)

negative integers :-
86 % 7 = 2 it means agar hum 86 me se 2 minus kar de to hme  7 se divisible number milega
86 % -7 = -5 it mean agar hum 86 - (-5) =91 it is divisible by 7
-86 % 7 = 5  here -86 - 5 = -91 which is divisible by 7
-86 % -7 = -2 here -86 +2=-84 which is divisible by 7

Agar divider like 7 is positive to hm 86 ko niche kar rhe hai particular value k se so that wo 7 se divisible ho jaye and k can be negative and positive depends on divisor
agar divider is negative to hm number ko bda rhe hai particular value k se so that wo -7 se divisible ho jaye that can be positive or negative note : k=remainder
