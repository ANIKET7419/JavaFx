 1.    If it is a  jar file then -classpath should be -classpath -----.jar
 2.    If it is a class file then classpath should be location of directory of the file
 3.    If -classpath is used with javac or java or any tool then only the given value will be used neither env variable or not default - current working directory where command is executed
 4.    If -classpath is not used then only env variable will be preferred only not default
 5.    If env varible is not mentioned then only default option is available
 Note : whether file is found or not ( applicable for 3,4,5)
java class_name
if classname is given with / or . then it is considered inside that package

java aniket.hello.op

class aniket.hello.op
{
}

jvm now search for aniket.hello.op class in the classpath/aniket/hello/
where op.class is stored and  inside the bytes code class have name aniket.hello.op




Note : Programmer can not use . symbol or / while defining a class name in source code
. or / is used by javac.  javac convert
package aniket;
class a
{

}

into
class aniket.a
{
}

For example in source code
class a.b
{

} // it is illegal bcz we can not use . or / for identifier

but in byte code
class a.b
{

} it is legal .
