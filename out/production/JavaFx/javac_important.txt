javac /.../.../.../___.java
it will compile and store the all class byte codes in the same directory where .java file is stored
But we can override it by using -d attribute d stands for directory now in this case it will stored bytes codes according to their package name
but if we do not use -d then it will stored the bytes code in the same directory where .java file is stored irrespective their package name

for example

--->>>>. aniket.java stored in /op/bro directory  ---->>>>

package uiop;
class a
{
}

javac /op/bro/aniket.java

it will store  a.class in the location /op/bro/

but if we use

javac -d /op/op2/ /op/bro/aniket.java

it will store uiop/a.class in location /op/op2/

it means /op/op2/uiop/a.class
