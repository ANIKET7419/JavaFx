interface can not be final
abstract class  can not be final
if class contain abstract function then it is compulsory to use abstract keyword with class name
abstract class  op{

}
//Valid

class abstract   op{

}
//Not Valid

we know enum is by default final but instead also we can not use final keyword with enum

final keyword can not be used with constructor
