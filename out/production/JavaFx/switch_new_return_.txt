java 14 supports switch expression
data_type variable_name=switch(expression){
case constant_exp , constant_exp // for multiple value ->
value or {multiple statement then yield value; } //after yield we can not use any statement in that block
}
we can not use return statement in the switch expression where a variable is waiting for its value
this swicth expression can also be without catching variable.
no need to use break statement in this new expression but we can use but in the same block not out of it or in single line if block is not used
in earlier switch we could do this out of block or inside the block
// same happen with lambda expression if it is without block then we can not use return it there is any return type in function prototype
if it is block then we have to use return if return type is given [ same goes with yield ]

in a switch expression we can not use both type of case at a same time
like
(i) case :  default :
 (ii) case -> default ->
we can use , to seperate multiple values in  new switch expression

//there is a problem [ Compile time ] whether after this in any statement we used Scanner class or not

for Date class absolute import will be used [ sql wala in this case ]
