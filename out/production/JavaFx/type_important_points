As we know 
byte - 1 byte 
short - 2 bytes 
char - 2 bytes 
int - 4 bytes 
long - 8 bytes 
float - 4 bytes
double - 8 bytes 
boolean size varies according to jvm - 1 byte in most of the case
Note : we can not convert boolean to any type and any type to boolean and  boolean is not 0 or 1 in java
using implicit type conversions we can not do :
 can not assign higher type value to lower type value except special cases mentioned later
order is : byte < short != char < int < long < float < double it is not according to bytes it is according to their ranges 
short represent -> -number to +number but char represent 0 to number

         
         

using implicit type conversion we can do :


higher type value = lower type  value
but not hold with short and char bcz of their range if variable is used in the right hand side 
long = int true
float =long true
double =float true
int =long false
float =double false
char = byte true if does not contain variable bcz all byte , char , short automatically converted into integer type if expression is evaluated
short = char true if char is literal otherwise error
char = short true if short is literal 

Now there are some special case exist between short , byte , integer , char ->
if higher  type is literal and within the range  then we can assign to lower
for ex : char a= 20 (integer type );
         byte b=20 integer type ;
         short c= 90 (integer type)
         byte d=567; it is error bcz it is not in range of byte
         if right hand side include any variable (address) then this special case will not hold anymore 
         for example:
         int a=1;
         char b=a; (error)
         if the higher type of right hand side is any of char, byte , short it is always automatically converted into integer type ( literal if not contain any address otherwise simple integer type)
         this special case is not hold with long , double , float 


Note : this special case not hold in function parameter and argument case

Example : ->
 static void okay(int y,int op)
    {

        System.out.println("One");
    }

okay(90,90) ; //correct


static void okay(int y,byte op)
    {

        System.out.println("One");
    }

okay(90,90) ; //error

static void okay(int y,short op)
    {

        System.out.println("One");
    }

okay(90,90) ; //error


static void okay(int y,char op)
    {

        System.out.println("One");
    }

okay(90,90) ; //error


so to avoid this we have to explicitly type cast the value like (byte)90 .






using explicit type conversion we can do anything except boolean conversions.


note suffix for literal types : ->


long - l 
double - d (default suffix with all . number if f is not used )
float  - f


hexadecimal - 0xa1161;
binary - 0b101010;
octal 01717;
